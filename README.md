My first react native app :)

Room screen with available chat rooms with information about last message and room name.<br>
Chat screen with messages implemented using react-native-gifted-chat.<br>

## Tech

- react native.
- apollo/graphql - consuming API.
- react-navigation - navigating between screens.
- typeScript - better safe than sorry.
- react-native-svg - rendering SVG icons.
- expo - project setup.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marmichno/chatApp.git
